## Command-line Course
The course is an introduction to the UNIX environment and the Bash command line. It's taught from a linguistic's perspective but is useful for everyone. As a second-year computer science student, I already knew a lot of the course matter, but I still learned new things and formed a better understanding of others.

### Introduction to Command-Line Environments
Bash is the most used UNIX command language. It's run by the Bash interpreter in a terminal, or shell. Cp for copying and mv for moving and renaming files are commonly used Bash commands. Nano and Vim are popular command-line text editors.

`mv directory1/file1 directory2/` moves file1 to directory2.

I knew most of the first week's subject matter. I learned some details about file extensions and how Unix and Linux are different from each other.

### Navigating a UNIX System
Unix systems have different user roles. The superuser account has the privilege to make unrestricted system-wide changes. Sudo is used to run programs as the superuser. The chmod command is used to change file permissions. Ssh is a secure connection over which it is possible to contact a remote server.

`sudo su` changes the current user to superuser.

I knew most of the second week's topic beforehand, but the part about processes in Unix I wasn't too familiar with.

### Corpus Processing
The command line can be a useful tool for linguists. Pipes are used to redirect the output of a program as the input of another one. Grep matches plain-text data to a regular expression.

`cat book.txt | grep "word" | wc -l` prints the number of lines in book.txt where "word" is found.

I learned a lot this week. I hadn't done very much piping and text processing through the command line before. Some commands like sed were completely new to me.

### Scripting and UNIX Configuration Files

### Installing and Running Programs

### Version Control

This was probably the easiest week for me. I've used git for the entirety of my studies. The topic was very familiar and there wasn't that much new information for me.

### Building Webpages using GitHub Pages
